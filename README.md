# random
Random generator (Java & C#)

**DESCRIPTION**<br>
This random generator needs 3 values. Starting value, ending value (NOTE: the ending value must be higher than the starting value) and the ammount of numberes to display (AONTD).
First it generates every number between start and end values and places it in an array.
Then it shuffles the array, takes numbers from first to AONTD, puts them in another array and sorts it.
The display function just prints the second array.
